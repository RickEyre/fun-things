Spawned from a question a friend was working on when learning C++:

> Write a program to play poker! You can provide 5 cards to the player, let that player choose new
> cards, and then determine how good the hand is. Think about whether this is easy to do? What
> problems might you have in terms of keeping track of cards that have been drawn already? Was this
> easier or harder than the slot machine?
